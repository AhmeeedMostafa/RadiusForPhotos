## About Radius
This Radius script was a free static responsive template from [**templated.co**](https://templated.co/radius/), so I (Ahmed Mostafa) downloaded  and programmed it to be functional and dynamic web site.

## What's its functionality
It's allow anyone to upload a photo with title and caption, he could edit the photo, its title and caption using the pin he put while uploading the photo
I used to pin system as I didn't make a registration system for users so to be everyone uploaded a photo able to edit the photo again I included this pin feature, after uploading user can share the link with the others.
